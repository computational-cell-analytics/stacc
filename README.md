# STACC

STACC is a tool for automated counting in biomedical images.

You can find its documentation at [https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/stacc/](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/stacc/).

**We are in the process of finalizing the first version of STACC and will soon add a license to this repository and upload the two pre-trained models to BioImage.IO.**
